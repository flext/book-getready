*"And yes, it wasn’t easy to break our comfortable habits and start to have three meetings a day for around two weeks, instead of dilly-dallying in front of a computer for the whole day... but we did it. We put our introversive natures aside and fought for the sake of the people who trust us - our users."* (UXPin CEO Marcin Treder on [Creative Bloq](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/ux-design-start-ups-get-know-your-users-10126004))

# User-centered design

Consumers are investing time and effort to rethink product design to suit their individual needs. In effect, they are becoming co-producers and stakeholders in the products they are going to *love*. Product designers not only take heteregenous and often conflicting needs into account, but also anticipate how these interact in daily use. They **design the product to meet usage patterns** – rather than finding a use for technology.

Product design starting with technology looking for possible usages always risks addressing user needs half-heartedly. Mapping the mental model of the technology directly to product usage limits alternative and typically more successful usages later on. In most cases, developing and validating viable product usages greatly improves or even transforms the initial idea.

There are no statistics on how many products could have acquired greatness but **failed for not knowing the user**. User-centered design is all about usage experiments involving potential users – and making strategic decisions based on feedback and analysis on which features add real value for which kind of user.

| Definition of *user-centered design* (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design)) |
| -- |
| User-centered design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem solving process that not only requires designers to analyse and foresee how users are likely to use a product, but also to test the validity of their assumptions with regard to user behaviour in real world tests with actual users. ... The chief difference from other product design philosophies is that user-centered design tries to optimize the product around how users can, want, or need to use the product, rather than forcing the users to change their behavior to accommodate the product. |



## User experience first

What is User eXperience (UX) design? After all, the idea of "designing" someone else's experience is quite ambitious. An experience is one of the most personal moments based on endless impressions and external factors. Designing an experience for the 'typical' user leaves out the many 'untypical' users, which is why personas can be a double-edged sword.

Dan Saffer at Kickerstudio described it well in words and images (see diagram): UX design is about "coordination between the various disciplines, or what used to be called creative direction ... the joining of the different disciplines ... We don’t design experiences; **we design the products that allow for experiences to happen**."[^1] The user interface (UI) provides affordances for great experiences.

The diagram shows the disciplines that are involved in enabling awesome user experiences. The user experience designer acts as orchestrator of experts who contribute the best of their skills to create something bigger than the parts. The analogy to classical music fits well. Smaller ensembles can jam the parts together without someone directing. But a certain size calls for some form of coordination to create something greater out of the many parts.

| User needs are defining the brand – not just the product |
| -- |
| Customers favor the higher ground clearance and better view afforded by a higher seating position in sport utility vehicles. But that comes with a higher loading lip of the trunk – good for small items but not for loading large or heavy items. Lowering the load-in height requires setting priorities based on evidence: Are our customers loading small or large items? What's the impact on ground clearance in rough terrain? This example alone opens three brand-defining product usages and customer segments: lifestyle, city transport, and off-road transport. Addressing the needs of customers and setting priorities defines not just the product but the entire brand. |

| "There is no single methodology for creating the perfect product – but you can increase your odds. One of the best ways is to understand users' reasons for doing things. *Mental Models* gives you the tools to help you grasp, and design for, those reasons. Adaptive Path co-founder Indi Young has written a roll-up-your-sleeves book for designers, managers, and anyone else interested in making design strategic, and successful." |

## Information architecture

**Information matters**. From the simplest messaging app to the greatest intranet, defining the information resources and how they are easily found matters most. And because it matters most, the user is involved when defining what information addresses her need and how she gets to it.

| DEFINITION |
| -- |
| *[Information architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture)* (by Wikipedia)|
| "Information architecture is the structural design of shared information environments ... organizing and labeling ... [content] and software to support usability and findability ... Typically, it involves a model or concept of information which is used and applied to activities that require explicit details of complex information systems."|

**Information needs.** To identify the information needs of potential users, for example, doing brainstorming and an affinity diagram (see below). The first point to brainstorm is, of course:
1. *Who are the users?* Typically, there are different kinds or groups of users that could benefit from the app.

 (The following questions are answered for each of the user groups.)

2. *Why would they use the app?* Ideas need to identify user goals when using the app.

3. *What information do users need?* Answers should focus sharply on the user goals identified before.

4. *How do users get the information?* Ideas here can have deep implications for app development.

5. *Why would users NOT use the app?* Answers here can help prioritize requirements for app development.

Depending on the requirements identified in question 4, users can co-create how information is organized and presented. If requirements require data sourcing for data-heavy applications, Chapter 3 on data-driven design provides more on that.

| "The affinity diagram is a business tool used to organize ideas and data ... stemming from brainstorming to be sorted into groups, based on their natural relationships ... The affinity diagram organizes ideas with following steps: 1.Record each idea on cards or notes; 2. Look for ideas that seem to be related; 3. Sort cards into groups until all cards have been [assigned]."|

Those who choose to install an application on their phone either receive a native app(lication) or a hybrid app ... While the structure of a responsive site may follow more “standard” patterns, native apps, for example, often employ navigational structures that are tab-based ... let’s take a look at some of the most popular patterns: Hierarchy, Hub & spoke, Nested doll, Tabbed view, Bento box and Filtered view." |


## Software architecture

**Decision, decision.** With user groups and their information needs defined, the question is whether to go native or with a cross-platform framework. FLEXT focuses on a few essential IO elements, such as file browser, menus, widgets, and notifications, providing *consistent behavior* across major platforms on all web-enabled devices.

Software developers can reuse and combine FLEXT elements, customize their appearance, and benefit from peer-reviewed quality and constant improvements while enjoying the greatest freedom when it comes to implementing their applications. The decision to go native or with a cross-platform framework is theirs (see RECOMMENDED below for a great overview).

Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders, captures early decisions about the high-level design, and allows reuse of design components between projects ...  The scope of software architecture ... consists of high-level components and connectors, as opposed to implementation details ... This abstraction provides ... a basis for analysis of software systems' behavior before the system has been built ... for re-use of elements and decisions ... [and] supports early design decisions that impact a system's development, deployment, and maintenance life." |

## Industrial design

**The framework.** FLEXT is designed to optimize the ergonomics, functionality, usability, and production of applications. Its IO elements are *ergonomically placed* on the screen, they are *multi-functional* while providing *consistent behavior* to optimize usability, and their *built-in features* and *adaptive form factor* couple custimization and production efficiency.

FLEXT is derived from year-long user involvement and living labs with 15 end user organizations during the first [Fusepool](http://www.fusepool.eu) project of Xerox Research, Swissdat, Bern University of Applied Sciences and other big data companies. The result is a well-tested framework of IO elements for data-driven applications on web-enabled devices.
