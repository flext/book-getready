# USER-CENTERED DESIGN

Consumers are becoming co-producers and stakeholders in the products they are going to *love*. Product designers take these heteregenous and sometimes conflicting needs and anticipate how these interact in daily use. They **design the product to meet user needs** – rather than finding a use for technology.

Mapping the mental model of the technology directly to product use limits alternative and typically more broader uses later on. In most cases, developing and validating several viable product uses greatly improves, extends or even transforms the initial scope.

There are no statistics on how many products could have acquired greatness yet **failed for not knowing the user**. User-centered design is all about use experiments with potential users – and making strategic decisions based on feedback and analysis on which features add real value for which kind of user.

## User experience

**Design?** The idea of *designing* someone’s experience is quite ambitious. An experience is one of the most personal moments based on endless impressions and external factors. A better analogy is orchestrating the parts that create awesome experiences when they play together. The product provides *affordances for great experiences*.

<br>

> User Experience (UX) involves a person’s behaviors, attitudes, and emotions about using a particular product, system or service. *[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience)*

<br>

The user experience designer orchestrates the experts who contribute the best of their skills to create something bigger than the parts. The analogy to classical music fits well. Smaller ensembles can jam the parts together without someone directing. But a certain size calls for some form of coordination to create something greater out of the parts.

[**KNOW USERS AND THEIR TASKS**](http://hcibib.org/tcuid/chap-2.html) (Clayton Lewis & John Rieman)

There was a startup here ... but they didn’t ... figure out *exactly who* would use the system to do *exactly what* ... [and] when the time came to line up test users ... there were no takers! Not only were there no people waiting to fork out cash for the tool, there weren’t even people who would take it for *nothing*.

The first step is to find some real people who would be potential users of what you are going to build. If you can’t find any you need to worry a lot. If you can’t find them now, where will they come from when it’s time to buy? When you have found some, get them to spend some time with you discussing what they do and how your system might fit in.

Once you have some people to talk with, develop *concrete, detailed examples* of tasks they perform or want to perform that your system should support ... [describe]
*what* the user wants to do but do not say *how* the user would do it, ... [be] very specific, ... describe a complete job, ... say who the users are.

## Information architecture

**Information matters**. From the simplest messaging app to the greatest intranet, defining the information resources and how they are easily found matters most. And because it matters most, the user is involved when defining what information addresses her need and how she finds it.

<br>

> Information architecture is the structural design of shared information environments. *[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture)*

<br>

**Information needs.** Brainstorming and affinity diagrams (see below) are good for identifying the information needs of potential users. The first point to brainstorm is, of course:

1. *Who are the users?* Typically, there are different kinds or groups of users that could benefit from the app.

 (The following questions are answered for each of the user groups.)

2. *Why would they use the app?* Ideas need to identify user goals when using the app.

3. *What information do users need?* Answers should focus sharply on the user goals identified before.

4. *How do users get the information?* Ideas here can have deep implications for app development.

5. *Why would users NOT use the app?* Answers here can help prioritize requirements for app development.

Depending on the requirements identified in question 4, users can co-create how information is organized and presented. If requirements require data sourcing for data-heavy applications, Chapter 3 on data-driven design provides more on that.

[**INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE FOR MOBILE**](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/designing-for-mobile-part-1-information-architecture) (Elaine McVicar)

Mobile users that choose to view content in their browser are best served with either a mobile-specific site ... or a responsive site ... Those who choose to install an application on their phone either receive a native app(lication) or a hybrid app ...

While the structure of a responsive site may follow more ‘standard’ patterns, native apps, for example, often employ navigational structures that are tab-based ... some of the most popular patterns [are]: Hierarchy, Hub & spoke, Nested doll, Tabbed view, Bento box and Filtered view.

## Software architecture

**Decision, decision.** With user groups and their information needs defined, the question is whether to go native or with a cross-platform framework. FLEXT focuses on a few core IO elements, such as file browser, menus, widgets, and notifications, providing *consistent behavior* across major platforms on all web-enabled devices.

<br>

> Software architecture ... consists of high-level components and connectors, as opposed to implementation details. *[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)*

<br>

**Reuse and combine.** Software developers can reuse and combine IO elements, customize their appearance, and benefit from peer-reviewed quality and constant improvements while enjoying the greatest freedom when it comes to implementing their applications. The decision to *go native* or with a cross-platform framework is theirs.

[**MODERN WEB APP ARCHITECTURE**](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/645753/Challenges-solutions-Architecture-of-a-Modern-Web) (Syed Rafey Husain)

Modern web applications could easily be decomposed into two distinct code bases. One that runs on server infrastructure and the other that runs on end user devices ... This leaves web application development teams in making a variety of decisions regarding application compatibility, performance, usability and maintainability ...

Popular end user devices like laptops, tablets and smart phones could run two different kinds of web applications: a responsive HTML website ... or a *native* web application ... Native apps are built using: 1. Device SDK (e.g., iOS SDK, Android SDK, Windows Phone SDK); 2. Cross platform SDKs PhoneGap, Flex, or Xamarin; 3. HTML5 and JavaScript based hybrid frameworks.

## Industrial design

**The framework.**

<br>

> Industrial design ... improve[s] the aesthetics, design, ergonomics, functionality, and/or usability of a product. *[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design)*

<br>

**User involvement.** FLEXT is derived from a year-long living lab with 15 end user organizations during the [Fusepool](http://www.fusepool.eu) project of Xerox Research, Swissdat, Bern University of Applied Sciences and other big data companies. The result is a well-tested framework of core IO elements for data-driven applications on web-enabled devices.

[**COMMON INTERFACE MISTAKES**](http://www.designingforinteraction.com/wroblewski.html) (Luke Wroblewski)

The most common interface design mistakes I see are overstatements of visual contrast ... The problem is when every element on a screen is shouting to get noticed ­no one gets heard. As a user, you can recognize these types of designs because your eyes bounce from one element to the next. There is no *hierarchy* and as a result no flow through the content and actions on the screen.

Similarly, many designers will overemphasize the differences between individual interface elements through multiple visual relationships: different font, size, color, and alignment. You don’t need excess visual contrast to distinguish objects or make things findable. Think about ways to “eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.”

## Interaction design

**All about flow.** With a working knowledge of FLEXT and of the app’s information and software architecture, composing compelling workflows is next. Information architecture and interaction design work together to guide the user through content (and tasks). FLEXT IO elements are fully customizable while leaving the large pane for what matters most: *content, content, content*.

<br>

> Interaction design ... [is] the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services. *[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design)*

<br>

**Elements and sequence.** Interaction designers enjoy great freedom to differentiate their app when it comes to workflows. They can arrange the control pane and compose IO elements on any side of the screen, have expanding, side or tabbed menus, and create simple or multi-level interaction sequences for user tasks – with complete freedom over the content pane.

<br>

[**INTERACTION DESIGN FOR MOBILE**](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/designing-for-mobile-part-2-interaction-design) (Elaine McVicar)

Mobile devices give designers less space to add menus and navigational cues than they might be used to on a desktop computer. Combined with environmental factors – such as poor viewing conditions and/or distractions – it’s often difficult for us to provide users with a good grasp of our content’s structure.

Main (or ‘primary’) navigation is a visual manifestation of our website (or application)’s information architecture. Here are a few options to consider: Expanding Menu, Side menu, Tabbed menu, Hub and spoke menu ... Pressing links to activate content facilitates flow, making it easy for the user to quickly select content with one hand ... [e.g.] Press to move forward, Coverflow, Flip over / Peel back.

## Visual design

**Dressing up.** Information and software architecture define structure while interaction design defines process. Visual design dresses the skeleton up in a way that supports the intelligibility of structure and process. It includes the layout of the content pane, the appearance of IO elements, and style including the sensible use of color.

<br>

> Visual design ... represents the aesthetics or look-and-feel of the front end of any user interface. *[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design#Visual_design)*

<br>

**Layout, style, imagery.** Visual designers enjoy the greatest freedom to differentiate their app when it comes to look-and-feel. They have complete control over the content pane and can customize almost any aspect of the the control pane including the appearance and form factor of FLEXT IO elements. Default values and themes help bootstrapping and reusing designs quickly.

<br>

___

[**VISUAL DESIGN FOR MOBILE**](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/designing-mobile-part-3-visual-design) (Elaine McVicar)

The touch screen interface on a mobile device also means the visual design must reinforce the interactions; in other words, sizing and placement of elements should ensure ease of use, and indicate the importance and correlation between actions ...

The human brain interprets visual information much faster than words, meaning it can be incredibly valuable to use visuals and imagery to enhance communication. Good visual styling will add value, support the purpose of the content or interactions, and improve the overall user experience (for mobile and desktop).
